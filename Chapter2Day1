1. Deploy a contract to account 0x03 called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named is, and make it have type String. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.


0x03
pub contract JacobTucker{
  pub let is: String
      init() {
        self.is = "the best"
    } 
}

Script: 

import JacobTucker from 0x03

 pub fun main(): String {

  return JacobTucker.is
 
}
